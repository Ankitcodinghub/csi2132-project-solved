The goal of this project is to enable you to gain experience in the design of an enterprise relational database system as well as its operation. The application domain under consideration is a dental centre. Dental practice management is a challenging job, especially for Dentists who are already busy caring for patients. Hence, it is essential to have the right system to manage the day-to-day operations of clinics. As part of a new information system development project for a dental centre with clinics in major cities across Canada, you are required to develop a Dental Clinic Management System (DCMS) to automate how information is managed. The application description and minimum requirements are presented in the next section. Please note that extensions to the minimal requirements stated are highly encouraged. You can study any dental centre of your choice to get some domain knowledge. Ensure that all the entities, attributes, relationships and constraints needed to design the database application are properly identified. This project should be carried out by a group of at least 4 (+ 1) students to ensure project completion before the submission deadlines.

Application Description:

Dental healthcare professionals are required by law to produce and maintain adequate dental records or dental charts, containing the necessary details of patients and dental history. Dental care services are, in general, communities with dental practitioners (e.g., dentists, hygienists), patients and systems that need constant monitoring and communication with each other. For most dental practices, the availability of a system to manage employee profiles, patient details, treatments, appointments, billings, reviews, etc. is very important to support dental operations.

In this project, you are required to develop a Dental Clinic Management System (DCMS) for a dental centre with clinics in major cities across Canada (e.g., Toothworks dental clinics). This will provide an efficient and a fast way for the dental centre to manage appointments and related activities. In addition, a DCMS will enable the dental centre practitioners to track records, minimize data loss, provide privacy &amp; security of records, enable quick report generation, implement updates, eliminate redundant paper work, and save time. Below are a few minimal requirements you need to consider. Note that they can be extended to fit your selected dental centre.

Users: All users, e.g., admin, dentist, etc. must be authenticated before using the system.

Project Requirements:

E-R Model

Construct an E-R diagram representing the conceptual design of the database. Since there are many variations of the original version (which represented relationships as diamonds), you can use other forms you prefer, e.g., IDEFIX, IE CROWâ€™s foot model, etc. At a minimum, you must include all the entities and relationship sets implied. They should not be assumed as completely identified under the project requirements. Be sure to identify the primary keys, relationship cardinalities, etc.

Relational Model

After constructing your E-R Diagram, you need to translate it into the relational database design. Define the necessary constraints that will ensure the correctness of the database to be created according to your Relational model. These are primary keys, referential integrity constraints, domain constraints and user-defined constraints. Implement the relations in the DBMS, e.g., PostgreSQL, and make sure that you create indices and constraints as appropriate. Whenever you discover flaws that require changes to your E-R Diagram, make sure these changes are captured in your relational model.

Populate Relations

Your database needs to be populated with data after creating it. You are required to generate sample data for your tables. Please note that adding enough data will make your queries interesting.

Queries:

This part of the DBMS is very important. Write some queries to perform the following (Note, you can showcase other information that your system can generate):

<ol>
<li>Show the list dentists in each branch.</li>
<li>Add new patients</li>
<li>Check upcoming appointment with the dentist</li>
<li>Set a new appointment</li>
<li>Add a new employee</li>
<li>Check the types of procedures available</li>
</ol>
Interfaces:

Several users will need to make use of the database and each will require special application during access.

<ul>
<li>Receptionist UI: They need to be able to add patient information, edit patient information, set patient appointments.</li>
<li>Dentists/Hygienist UI: They will need to be able to retrieve the records of appointed patients easily. They will need to track the patientâ€™s data, e.g., check medical history before administering new procedures.</li>
<li>Patient UI: They will need access to their records, e.g., medical history, upcoming appointments or schedule with the dentists.</li>
</ul>
